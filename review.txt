1. Limited novelty.
   Adding labels as extra features is a common trick in multi-label learning, it can also be done for other learning approaches. The author did not make it clear why exploring relationship with tree classifiers is better. 

2. Lack of compared methods. The motivation to explore label correlation is to improve classification performance, however, in the experiment,
