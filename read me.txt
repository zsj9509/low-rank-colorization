How to use:

1. provide the data
	a. an m*n matrix B (monochrome image)
	b. an m*3n matrix D (color image whose nonzero entries represent the input labels)
	c. an m*3n matrix Omega (entry "1" indicates the corresponding pixel is labelled)
	d. >> Data.B = B; Data.D = D; Data.Omega = Omega;

2. The Low-Rank method (LR) OR the Low-rank + Local-color-consistency method (LL)
	a. LR: [L S X] = ColorizationLR(Data, lambda, eta)
	   LL: [L S X] = ColorizationLL(Data, lambda, eta)
	   The meaning of the variables L, S, X, lambda, eta are specified in Eq. (5) of the paper.
	b. use the matlab commmand 
		>> img = reshape(L, [m, n, 3]);
           to get the colorized image.

3. If the labels are provided manually:
	a. rename the monochrome image as "BW.png"
	b. rename the color image containting the labels as "manual.png"
	c. run the script "process_manual_labeled_image.m" to obtain "Data".
